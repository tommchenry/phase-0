<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was pretty easy, though the instructions were a little confusing as the Berkshire site has changed since the exercise was written and we had to navigate compromising how it looks now with how it looked in the example and what we're able to do using only HTML. We opted against using tables in favor of building one long unordered list. It was good practice writing links and list items over and over.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    My pair and I were able to pretty quickly research the few semantic elements we used on the site.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    We did a good job at keeping to best practices. We worked off of a properly formatted HTML skeleton to begin with and avoided using formatting in the HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML's limitations seem to give it a lot of its power - because it can only be used for structure and semantic markup and not full programming, there are lots of options for adding more and more rich information to a page instead of trying to split the difference between all of that and function. The lack of styling options in best practices HTML also limits how good pure HTML can look on a page. For example: you can have hierarchies of information with headers and italics and bold text, but it's all in one font and one color.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I think of HTML as a bunch of nested parentheses, where each parentheses is a tag. It wouldn't make sense to have half a set of parentheses, so it doesn't make sense to have only an open tag. Most of the tag names make sense as abbreviations or shortened words, so learning what they abbreviate makes writing HTML much, much easier.
