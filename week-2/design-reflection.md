##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?##

1. *Information Gathering* - This step involves asking a lot of questions of yourself (or the client) in order to determine the purpose of the site, the site's audience, and the site's content.
2. *Planning* - This is the step that this challenge centers on and largely involves creating a site map in order to organize the different parts of the site into a coherent navigation system.
3. *Design* - This step where a prototype design of the site is created, usually as a flat image of what the final site will eventually look like.
4. *Development* - This step involves creating the actual site itself, using HTML, CSS and other web technologies to create a functional web page from the design prototype.
5. *Testing and Delivery* - This step involves heavily testing the site produced from the development phase in order to insure the site is fully functional.
6. *Maintenance* - This is the final and ongoing step in creating a site: maintaining and updating the content on the site in order to keep it engaging and functional for users.

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?##

>My site's primary goal is to inform potential employers about the range of interests and skills I have. It will feature my writing in the form of a blog in addition to my comics and programming work.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?##

>My target audience's interests would be innovative comics and game design work, and my site will showcase my work as a way to promote my skills and the work that I've done.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.##

>The user should be directed to see my portfolio of work: writing, art, and programming. If they're a personal user this should encourage them to play my games and purchase my materials on sale. If they're a user representing a prospective employer, it should encourage them to hire me on the strength of this work and drive them to contact me directly.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?##

>Design is built on solving a client's problems within the limitations of the medium. For web design, this means the limitations like screen size, connection speed, browser-specific quirks, and current technologies. A good designer is able to create a user experience within these limitations that allows the user to meet her needs with as little obstruction as possible.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?##

>User experience design is design that's focused on considering the needs of the user first and foremost and designing the site to address those needs as easily as possible. Good user experience design can take incredibly complex sites and systems and make them much more pleasant to interact with for users. This is especially important for casual or first-time users of a site who can frustrate easily if it's difficult to find what they're looking for or accomplish what they've come to a site to do. By creating a positive user experience via design, users are more likely to have positive associations with the site and the company which should make them more likely to return and use the company's services again.

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?##

I found making a site map a little tedious, but only because I don't have much to add to the site beyond a few basic pages. I might also just be disheartened about this kind of site, as I've designed blog-portfolio combo sites for myself in the past without much success in attracting traffic or employment opportunities.
