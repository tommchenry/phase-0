**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

>Creating a repository on GitHub is easy once you've set up an account. Look at the menu bar across the top of the site. See the little profile picture? Clicking the plus next to it will drop down and give you the option to create a new account. You'll need to name the account something memorable, and you'll want to pick a license for the repository. Once the repository has been made, you can clone it to your local computer by going to the sidebar of the repository page and looking for the clone URL (look for the giant bold HTTPS). If you click the little clipboard icon, your computer will save the URL to the clipboard to make it easy to paste. Now open a Terminal window and navigate to the directory where you'd like to keep the repository. The command is simply: 'git clone' and then paste the URL you copied from above. Hit enter, and git will begin to clone the repository to your computer.

**Describe what open source means.**

>Open source means that the source code of a program is made publicly available so that anyone can read through it and suggest changes. Most software you purchase is closed source, meaning the source code can't be accessed by anyone but the developer or company that maintains the software, and so can't be changed by anyone but those same people.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

>I'm a fan of open source software. I wouldn't say it's necessarily "utopia," but it does create a culture and atmosphere that I tend to prefer to one of pure profit motive and secrecy. The learning opportunities alone that access to just one well maintained repository can provide when you're starting out are huge.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

>Licenses are important as they allow you to maintain ownership and some control over your work while opening it up to community involvement and collaboration. Open source doesn't have to mean you give your code away to the world for free and no one ever acknowledges your work. Licensing establishes your relationship with future collaborators, sellers, even producers of mostly different software that has roots in your work.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

>I never *really* knew what licensing agreements were before or why open source software used them. I share a lot of artwork using Creative Commons, but I didn't really understand that there were differences between licenses or why you would use one once you'd already put stuff up on GitHub. I also didn't know GitHub offered basic website hosting. That said, I didn't really struggle with any of the parts of the challenge -- everything went how it was supposed to, and I understood each step.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

>I didn't use any additional resources to help with this challenge, it was pretty straightforward to me.
