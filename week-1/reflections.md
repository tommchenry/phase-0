##1.1 Think About Time Reflection

For this assignment, I learned about new research into controlling and creating habits. I've been very interested in trying to find ways to work my interests into my daily routine and I've had inconsistent results. Watching the Tiny Habits video really engaged me as I saw the parts where I was onto something (finding triggers throughout the day) and parts where I was way off (starting very, very small).
"Time Boxing" is when you take a block of time with a specific start and end point and work without distraction in that time period. After the box is over, you reflect on what worked and what didn't. I've already been using the Pomodoro technique in my day-to-day work life for a little over a year and I've benefited temendously from giving myself hard end times on my boxes and the quick break. Since this has been such an effective tool in my current time management, I intend to continue it into Phase 0. I'm already taking the week's assignments and breaking them into small chunks that are easy to squeeze in here and there. For the past year and a half, my personal system employs a lot of David Allen's Getting Things Done as well, and between those two strategies, I've significantly reduced my overall level of anxiety by trusting my system and using it consistently. I fully intend to continue applying this model to Phase 0 while tinkering with finding elements that work best for me.
I also plan to employ some of the Fogg Behavior Model as I enter Phase 0. I've started mapping out the regular triggers I'd hit each day, and brainstorming super-small behaviors I could work in. In addition to working in things like researching concepts I'm stuck on (skim one article on a subject), I believe this might also be a useful way to keep up with some of my outside DBC interests when the program gets really intense (do one pushup, play scales for 2 minutes, etc.).

##1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a text-based command line for interacting with an operating system and bash is a UNIX shell. A lot of this material is pretty familiar to me. Funny story: in the run-up to DBC, I actually did the Command Line Crash Course on my own because I was worried that knowing command line stuff would be important and I knew I wasn't very skilled with the command line or bash. I redid the course for this assignment, just to really drill it in, but it went very smoothly, and I was able to get each command working. That said, I still find thinking in terms of redirects and piping very difficult to wrap my head around. In the introductory video on this assignment, there's a one line solution with piping to solve a problem very similar to one that I recently had to solve for my job, and it was so much more elegant than what I wound up doing I got a little embarrassed. I think the nuts and bolts most important commands and arguments for me are still cd, ls, mv, cp, and rm. All the things I still rely on Finder or Windows Explorer for (too much).

*-pwd*
>This means "print working directory" and it shows you the directory and system you're currently in.
*-ls*
>This is short for "list" and it lists the files in a directory.
*-mv*
>This is short for "move" and it moves a file from one place to another.
*-cd*
.This is short for "change directory" and it changes your current directory to a directory you specify.
*-../*
>This means a directory above the current directory you're in. You can string them together to move back up a whole bunch of directories in the tree.
*-touch*
.This creates an empty file.
*-mkdir*
>This is short for "make directory" and it creates a directory.
*-less*
>This displays the contents of a file onto the screen one page at a time, letting you move through a lot of text.
*-rmdir*
>This is short for "remove directory" and it deletes a (empty) directory.
*-rm*
>This is short for "remove" and it deletes a file.
*-help*
>This shows you a manual page on whatever command you ask about.
