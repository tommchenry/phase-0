// 1. Create a new collection of statements called "sum" that expects to take in some group of numbers.
// 2. In this collection of statements, create a variable number called "total" and set its value to 0.
// 3. FOR each number in the group of numbers,
  //4. Add the number to the total and save the result as the new value of total.
// 5. Finally, return the numerical value of total.

// 1. Create a new collection of statements called "mean" that expects to take in some group of numbers.
// 2. In this collection of statements, create a variable called "total" and set its value to 0.
// 3. Create a variable called "result" and set its value to 0.
// 4. FOR each number in the group of numbers,
    // 5. Add the number to the total and save the result as the new value of total.
// 6. Divide final total by the length of the group of numbers and save the result as "result."
// 7. Finally, return the numerical value of "result."

// 1. Create a new collection of statements called "median" that expects to take in some group of numbers.
// 2. Sort this group of numbers from smallest to largest.
// 3. IF the length of the group of numbers is odd:
  // 4. Return the number that falls at the halfway point along the length of the sorted group of numbers.
// 5. ELSE
  //6. Divide the length of the group of sorted numbers in half.
  //7. Add the number that falls at this position to the number the next number in the group and divide the result by 2. Return this number.
