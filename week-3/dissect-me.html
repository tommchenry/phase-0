What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
<header>, <article>, and <footer> seem extremely useful, even in the most basic sites (like this template), as these elements are present almost by default on any page, while sidebars and navigation and individual sections aren't required until you start adding extra layers of design complexity.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
One way to think of how the browser displays elements is as though the browser is reading the page like a person, from the top down. You provide the important style information and other unseen code in the <head> tags like a preface, so that the browser knows what it's getting into. Then, as it proceeds down the page it starts laying things out. CSS might actually shift around the order the elements appear on the page from the way they exist in the HTML, but the browser reads from the top down, rendering things in order.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I had never created my own snippets in Sublime before, so it was interesting to walk through the syntax to make a new one. I plan on creating additional snippets that I can use, especially now that I've learned about tab completion and the ability to move between fields in a snippet.
